    This report describes the structural design of a residential solar canopy
    covering a a patio located in the City of Larkspur, California. It includes
    the design of a concrete slab and stem wall, a steel tube frame, and
    attachments of solar panels to the frame. The report is divided into the
    following divisions and subdivisions::

    Because the T&G roof is relatively more flexible, the effective floor load
    for seismic models is calculated as the sum of the floor and all of the
    partition weight.
