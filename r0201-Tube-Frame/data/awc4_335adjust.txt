    Where areas above and/or below an opening remain unsheathed, 
    the height of each opening shall be defined as the clear 
    height of the opening plus the unsheathed areas.					

    [2] The sum of the perforated shear wall segment lengths, Sum(L), 
    divided by the total length of the perforated shear wall. Lengths of 
    perforated shear wall segments with aspect ratios greater than 2:1 
    shall be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.3.4.3.
