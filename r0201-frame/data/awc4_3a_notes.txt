    [1] Nominal unit shear capacities shall be adjusted in 
    accordance with 4.3.3 to determine ASD allowable unit 
    shear capacity and LRFD factored unit resistance. For 
    general construction requirements see 4.3.6. For speciﬁc 
    requirements, see 4.3.7.1 for wood structural panel 
    shear walls, 4.3.7.2 for particleboard shear walls, and 
    4.3.7.3 for ﬁberboard shear walls. See Appendix A for 
    common and box nail dimensions.

    [2] Shears are permitted to be increased to values 
    shown for 15/32 inch (nominal) sheathing with same nailing 
    provided (a) studs are spaced a maximum of 16 inches on center, 
    or (b) panels are applied with long sdimension across studs.

    [3] For species and grades of framing other than Douglas-Fir-Larch 
    or Southern Pine, reduced nominal unit shear capacities shall 
    be determined by multiplying the tabulated nominal unit 
    shear capacity by the Speciﬁc Gravity Adjustment Factor = [1-(0.5-G)], 
    where G = Speciﬁc Gravity of the framing lumber from the 
    NDS (Table l2.3.3A). The Speciﬁc Gravity Adjustment Factor shall 
    not be greater than 1.

    [4] Apparent shear stiffness values Ga, are based on nail slip 
    in framing with moisture content less than or equal to 19% at 
    time of fabrication and panel stiffness values for shear walls 
    constructed with either OSB or 3-ply plywood panels. When 
    4-ply or 5-ply plywood panels or composite panels are used, 
    Ga values shall be permitted to be multiplied by 1.2.

    [5] Where moisture content of the framing is greater than 
    19% at time of fabrication, G, values shall be multiplied by 0.5.

    [6] Where panels are applied on both faces of a shear wall 
    and nail spacing is less than 6" on center 'on either side, 
    panel joints shall be offset to fall on different framing 
    members as shown below. Alternatively, the width of the 
    nailed face of framing members shall be 3" nominal or 
    greater at adjoining panel edges and nails at all panel 
    edges shall be staggered.

    [7] Galvanized nails shall be hot-dipped or tumbled.
