The residence is sheathed in exterior 1/2" 5-ply plywood nailed with 8d
common nails at 12" oc at edges and field. The boundary nailing capacity is
half of the maximum spacing tabulated in the building codes. The residence
is checked against the CRC prescriptive wall opening limits, assuming 6" oc
(which is not the case) to assess the degree of wall continuity. A CBC
analysis is performed in calculation 0301 which estimates the DC ratios for
the 12" oc nailing.

The existing foundation on the north and west side of the residence is a
concrete strip footing directly supporting the floor joists. On the south
side the floor joists are supported on 2x4 framed walls varying in height,
up to 6 feet. The framing is clad on the outside with 1x10 planks, spaced
1" apart for ventilation.

The foundation has two significant seismic deficiency. The first is a
significant torsional irregularity arising from lack of shear stiffness and
strength on the south and east walls. The existing structure has only one
compression brace along each wall and the spaced planks do not provide
meaningful strength or stiffness. This irregularity is a deficiency whether
the floor diaphragm is considered semi-rigid or flexible. The second is the
lack of adequate anchorage of the sill plates to the foundation. Existing
anchorage typically consists of only a single 1/2" anchor bolt and small
washer every 3 or 4 feet. 

**The torsional irregularities disqualify the foundation structure from
following a CRC design process.**

Seismic demands on the residence were analyzed using a 3D FEM model. The
model includes the full relevant geometry, loads and stiffness of the
walls, roof, floors and foundation.

The in-plane stiffness of the T&G roof is taken as 300 pounds/inch/inch
using test data from [USDA1972]. The in-plane stiffness of the plywood
shear walls and subfloor is estimated at 1000 pounds/inch/inch after
supplementary nailing, using values from CBC tables.
